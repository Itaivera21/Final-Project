            <p>
                Although I am still early in my IT journey, I am continuously 
                learning and working on small exercises, assignments, and 
                prototypes. This page will showcase my projects as they develop,
                reflecting my growth and creativity.

            <h3><span>2. Current Status</span></h3>
            <p>
                At the moment, I am focusing on strengthening my foundation in 
                programming, web development, and database management. These 
                skills will form the backbone of future projects I will share here.

            <h3><span>3. Future Projects</span></h3>
            <p>
                Upcoming projects will include web applications, data-driven solutions,
                and innovative tools designed to solve real-world problems. Stay tuned
                for updates as I continue to learn and create.
